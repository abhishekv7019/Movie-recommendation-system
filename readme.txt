The given code finds similar movies based on user ratings using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Imports and Data Loading:
   - csr_matrix from scipy.sparse for creating a sparse matrix.
   - numpy as np for numerical operations.
   - pandas as pd for data manipulation.
   - NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors for finding nearest neighbors.
   - The ratings data is loaded from 'ratings.csv' and movies data from 'movies1.csv'.

2. find_similar_movies Function:
   - Inputs:
     - movie_id: The ID of the movie for which similar movies are to be found.
     - k: The number of similar movies to find.
     - metric: The distance metric to use (default is 'cosine').
   - Steps:
     - The number of unique users (M) and movies (N) are calculated from the ratings DataFrame.
     - user_mapper and movie_mapper dictionaries are created to map user and movie IDs to indices.
     - movie_inv_mapper is created to map indices back to movie IDs.
     - User and movie indices are generated from the original IDs.
     - A sparse matrix X of shape (M, N) is created where each entry represents a rating given by a user to a movie.
     - X is transposed to shape (N, M) so that each row corresponds to a movie.
     - The function checks if the movie_id is in the dataset.
     - The movie index and vector are retrieved.
     - A k-nearest neighbors model is fitted on the transposed sparse matrix using the specified metric.
     - The k-nearest neighbors are found for the given movie vector.
     - Neighboring movie IDs are retrieved, excluding the first one (which is the movie itself).
     - The list of neighboring movie IDs is returned.

3. Example Usage:
   - The find_similar_movies function is called with a movie_id of 10 and k of 10.
   - The title of the input movie is retrieved and printed.
   - The titles of the similar movies are retrieved and printed.
